You mean you want me to update the SEO structure in the Graphics Designer Task component to match the simplified SEO data structure we established (only headlineScore, captionScore, and overallScore) instead of the complex analytics that were removed from the backend?

---

✅ Updated the overall SEO score display to use 0 instead of 'N/A' for consistency.

The Graphics Designer Task component is already using the simplified SEO structure correctly. It only references:
- `headlineScore` 
- `captionScore`
- `overallScore`

The component doesn't use any of the complex analytics data that was removed from the backend, so it's already aligned with the new simplified SEO data structure we established.
